# FractalityLab

## Overview
FractalityLab is a powerful Java-based tool for generating datasets of fractal images, suitable for machine learning applications. This utility is part of the `edux` machine learning library suite and is tailored for creating intricate datasets that can be used to train and improve machine learning models.
